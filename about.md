          Originally from the SF Bay Area, I have lived in several cities up and down the California, but for the last decade-plus my home has been the City by the bay. When I'm not knee-deep in the hoopla, you'll find me cooking, listening to music, or doing something sporty.

        Having grown up with housepets most of my life, it is unfortunately only recently that my living situation has allowed me to get an animal. Since 2022, Allie Katt has been a faithful sidekick, mostly supporting me by napping in solidarity while I work. She also enforces breaks at play times and meal times.

      <h6 class="fw-lighter lh-base">
        Given the nature of sedentary office work, I make it a point to try and balance that with physical activities by getting outdoors whenever possible. Luckily, the temperate Bay Area often obliges with glorious weather. Levels of skill vary, but on any given day I may be surfing, weightlifting, or playing tennis, volleyball, or ultimate (frisbee).
