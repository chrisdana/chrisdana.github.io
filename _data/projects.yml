  desc: >
        A classic brain teaser that involves arranging 15 golf tees (or pegs) 
        in an equilateral triangle on a board. One peg is then removed creating 
        an available hole. The goal is to jump over each peg with another peg, 
        removing the jumped-over peg, until only one remains. It is recreated 
        here for the Apple Watch.
