        Without trying to sound too meditative, my approach to software development is one of 
        balance, for example the balance between complexity and maintainability or between 
        optimization and reusability. I think this leads to software of enduring value and 
        is always a goal for which I strive.

        There is something fulfilling about squeezing every bit of performance from challenging 
        environments, and for me, firmware development provides that satisfaction. It's thrilling to 
        overcome hardware limitations and see the tangible results as a system comes to life.

        Another avenue I've found to scratch that efficiency itch is in test automation. Not 
        only does it free up manual testing bandwidth to solve larger challenges, but can also
        test deeper and further than would be otherwise feasible. The rapid feedback and iteration 
        that this enables can be transformative and I love being a part of that.

        Given the aforementioned, it makes sense that I would enjoy expanding into DevOps as well, 
        since it can make a similar impact across the entire build, test, and release workflow. The 
        integration of diverse tools and technologies ensures there is always something new and 
        exciting to master. Knowing its integral importance to a project, the rewarding feeling of 
        crafting a speedy and reliable CI pipeline is hard to match.
